# Plan (tentative)
I desperately need to get my hands in some code, so this read me isn't highly detailed and reflective of my regular planning behavior! I hope I don't regret jumping into things, but here we go!

1. Create homepage with links to 3 other pages 
2. Create database with current inventory (img to come later)
3. Add supabase client
4. Work on display page
5. Create hooks to fetch and display data 
6. Create form to add pops
7. Create hook to send data to supabase 
8. Make a plan for wishlist page!
I think this is enough for me to think through for now :) I will adjust this as I go!
